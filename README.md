# PS9594: Computational Text Analysis

This repo contains teaching materials for the "Computational Text Analysis" (PS9594) course at Western University. The book includes code, exercises, and slides for each week.

This will be the main resource we use throughout the course. You can access all of these materials, as well as the course overview by following [this link](https://svallejovera.github.io/regression_ci/). I will continue to update the site throughout the semester(s).
